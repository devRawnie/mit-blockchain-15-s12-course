Many tried to create a system to transfer money online, peer to peer

**How to transfer money peer to peer without a central intermediary?**

Satoshi Nakamoto, in his `p2p e-cash paper` emailed on 31 October, 2008 answered this

- Consensus Protocol
- Cost of Trust
- Byzantine Generals Problem (Satoshi solved this)

- What is Money?
  - Store of Value
  - Medium of exchanging services

- What is Finance
  - Valuation and Allocation of money

### Financial Sector Problems

- Repeated Crisis and Instability
- FIAT currency instabilities with unsound policies
- Centralized Intermediaries concentrate risks and economic rents
- Clearing and settlements costs

Financial sector prefers: 

**Permissioned Blockchain**
- Known set of participants
- No proof of work/ No mining
- Distributed Database Technology

**Permission less Blockchain**
- Unknown participants
- Security based on incentives
- Native currency is required for incentive
